      <description>Things have been hectic lately. After many days of constant work, we found free time this weekend. Sumi and I were reminiscing our childhood and I remembered the delicious Malpuas that mom used to make for us. She made it specifically for me as I loved them. Even though we have been to Kolkata 4 times the past 3 years, I last had Malpua 4 years back. I consciously asked mom not to prepare them for the past few years due to our low-carb diet.</description>

      <description>We love eggs. I guess post marriage the amount of eggs we have eaten is greater than my entire egg consumption before marriage. One of the primary reason being the simple manner in which we can cook it. Another reason being the various preparation we can have with them. Who would have thought a simple round thing can be so tasty yum Okay I am going way out of topic.</description>
