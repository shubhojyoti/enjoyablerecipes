      <description>Things have been hectic lately. After many days of constant work, we found free time this weekend. Sumi and I were reminiscing our childhood and I remembered the delicious Malpuas that mom used to make for us. She made it specifically for me as I loved them. Even though we have been to Kolkata 4 times the past 3 years, I last had Malpua 4 years back. I consciously asked mom not to prepare them for the past few years due to our low-carb diet.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s been ages since we had ice cream. You obviously know why? Our Diet!! Sometimes we feel frustrated with the diet. Even a single day matters. Sumi had reached her target weight quite a few months back. Believe it or not but she lost a whopping 37kg since she started on the diet. But she is struggling now to maintain it. I, on the other hand, have lost around 12kg since the start which is horrible.</description>
