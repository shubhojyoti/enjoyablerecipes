They bring out the flavors of any dish. They can be used as an appetizer, be an accompaniment with your main course or can even be used as a dessert. They can be sweet or a savory. The type and preparation of different chutneys has significant regional variations.\nI love sweet chutneys. You can find one of my eternal favorites here. Sumi loves the spicy varieties more. She makes this awesome South Indian style red chutney. It is very spicy but the the flavor of each ingredients makes it a unique experience. She made this last Sunday and made enough to last us the entire week.\n Red Chutney   Ingredients  Red Tomato - 2 large sized Onion - 1 small sized (cut into rough slices) Dried Red Chilli - 4 to 5 (deseeded) Garlic Cloves - 3 medium sized (peeled) Asafoetida - 1\u0026frasl;8 tsp Whole Black Mustard seeds - 1\u0026frasl;4 tsp Salt - 1\u0026frasl;4 tsp Clear oil such as rice bran - 1 tbsp  Method Cut the tomatoes into medium pieces and wash it properly to drain off all the seeds. Peel and cut the onion into medium pieces. Do not worry about making fine pieces. We will be making a paste anyway.\nDe-seed the chillies by breaking them open into two pieces. Rub them and the seeds will fall off. Be careful with your eyes and hand. I used 4 red chillies and they may be too much hot for you. You can vary the numbers as per your taste.\nCrush the garlic cloves.\nHeat the oil in a pan.\nAdd the black mustard seeds and saut√© for a 3-5 seconds until you hear them pop. Now add the asafoetida and saut√© quickly.\nAdd all other ingredients - red chillies, garlic cloves, onion and tomato and saut√© so that they are mixed well. Be careful not to burn the red chillies or any ingredients as that will spoil the taste.\nLet it cook for about 4-5 minutes. Stir in between so that the contents do not stick to the pan.\nRemove the contents from the pan. Spread them on a plate and let it cool completely.\nGrind the contents in a mixer grinder.\nPour into a container and serve it with dosa or idli.\nYou can also spice it up by tempering it with mustard seeds and curry leaves. If you want to do so, take 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp of oil, heat it separately in a pan, add 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp black mustard seeds and 4-5 curry leaves. Spread it over the chutney.\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/red-chutney/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Sides","image":null,"objectID":1488823131,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"categories","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/categories/sides/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Spicy","image":null,"objectID":1488823131,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/spicy/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Tomato","image":null,"objectID":1488823131,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/tomato/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Vegetarian","image":null,"objectID":1488823131,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"recipetypes","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipetypes/vegetarian/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Recipe List","image":null,"objectID":1487101616,"priority":"70","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"general","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipes/"},{"desc":null,"id":"The Dreaded About Page","image":null,"objectID":1487101616,"priority":"70","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":" Hey everyone, thanks for checking our blog. We are Shubhojyoti and Sumita (Boomboom and Sumi in short). We live in Bangalore and we are sporadic cooks. By sporadic, we mean that we do not cook everyday. Since both of us are employed and have a 8-5 job, sometimes we do feel lazy to cook. We also try to follow a low carb diet (Sumi has been more successful). We are Bengalis so no matter what we cook, a little amount of Bengali influence does enter all our recipes.\nShubhojyoti aka Shubho aka Boomboom Hiya. I am Boomboom. I have been online since 1999. I literally live online. I have dealt with WordPress sites since 2004 and I have been hooked ever since. Professionally I am a Network Protocol Tester. Its a typical job but I love it. My love for food has been like forever. And by looking at me you will understand why üòÄ My mom is a wonderful cook and all my taste has been acquired from her. I started cooking properly ever since I started my job and began living on my own. And it became regular since I married my best friend üôÇ We both were not regular cooks so it was really tough at the beginning. But I guess we have improved over time.\nSumita aka Sumi Hi all. I am Sumi. I always get stumped when I come to this page. I have been born and brought up in India and have always lived my life here. I married my husband Boomboom in 2008 after we have known each other for close to 6 years. Note the phrase ‚Äúknown each other‚Äù and not dating üôÇ Thats actually another story that I will tell you all someday. I work as a User Experience Designer here in Bangalore, India. Cooking is kind of a hobby that both Boomboom and me caught on after we got married and we HAD to feed each other üôÇ\nOur Cooking Boomboom says ‚Äì Our experiments with cooking started as a disaster. Sumi tells me she had never cooked in her whole life. But let me tell you, ever since she cooked the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù time she really dealt with it like a pro. Yes she made mistakes too but overall her food is tasty. I, on the other hand, is a ‚Äúfluke‚Äù cook. I have never been able to repeat the same taste in my dishes. I really don‚Äôt know why. There are only 2-3 dishes that I can replicate every single time. This is the reason most of the recipes on this blog will be Sumi‚Äôs üôÇ\nSumi says ‚Äì Don‚Äôt let Boomboom mess with you. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to cook. But the problem is not with me but the customer (Boomboom cough). He loves whatever I cook. Seriously if our roles would have changed, I would have left him a long time ago LOL. It‚Äôs a different story with him though. He cooks awesome. But he never acknowledges it. sigh\nThe Blog Now its both of us ‚Äì We both adore our moms‚Äô cooking. They are excellent cooks and both have so different styles that we really learn a lot from them. The first 1.5 years of our marriage passed with us just experimenting and trying to copy our moms. We did succeed to some extent and loved having Bengali food. During this time, the idea for the blog was born. Since we were improving and forgetting what we did the last time, this seemed to the best medium to remind us how to cook. Around June 2009, fed up with our overweight bodies, we decided to try a low carb diet. The low calorie option didn‚Äôt work for us. Ever since we went on that diet, our food habit changed radically. Now we really have forgotten lots of Bengali recipes üôÅ However we try as much as possible to tweak our meals. We removed lots of older recipes because they were not that great and moreover we would not get a chance to improve and update them right now due to our diet.\nWe plan to update our blog regularly now and hopefully the posts will pick up.

It celebrates the oncoming harvest. Bengalis celebrate this day by preparing some special sweets known as ‚ÄúPitha‚Äù. There are many types and I love all of them. My mom is an expert on these. I remember days of preparation in our home for the D-day. Most of the pithas had coconut as its main ingredient. My dad would buy lots of fresh coconuts and then he would grate them one by one. I loved to see him do this. He would break very small pieces and let me grate them too. I wish he were alive today and I could grate coconuts with me once more. He is the one person I miss most today.\nOf all the pithas mom made, my favourite has always been Patishapta. It is a pancake with a coconut and kheer filling. It tastes awesome while served hot. But once refrigerated it is even better. I still remember a funny story mom loves to tell everyone about me and Patishaptas. I was around 5 years old and mom was on one of her Pitha-making marathons. Dad had grated around 10 coconuts and mom used at least 4 of them for Patishaptas alone because all of us loved them. She made a fresh batch of the filling and the smell was all around the home. She kept a potful of hot filling on the dining table under the fan to cool. She came back after half an hour and saw that I had devoured half of the pot by myself LOL. Mom was angry and amused at the same time. She actually prepared extra for that batch because she knew I would sneak in hehehehe.\nHope you like this recipe. There are multiple versions of this but here is the one I tried with mom 2 years back.\n Patishapta Pitha \u0026#45; Sweet Pancakes with coconut filling   Ingredients For the filling\n Coconut - 1 Khowa - 200gm Raisins - 50gm Sugar - 1 cup Small Cardamom - 6 (powdered) Milk - as needed  For the pancake\n Maida (Refined Wheat Flour) - 2 cup Semolina (Sooji) - 1 cup Rice Powder - 1 cup Milk - 1-2 litres (or more depending on needs) Sugar - 1 cup Edible Soda - 1 pinch (you get it very less) Oil (refined and clear oil) - as needed  Method For the filling\nGrate the coconut. Put all ingredients in a wok. Condense the mixture by constantly boiling and cooling. Keep stirring and let all ingredients mix together till it turns into a dough like mixture and the oil from the coconut goes out. Add more milk if Khowa is not available. You need to be patient as the time it will take to condense and get the dough mixture right will be a lot.\nFor the pancake\nPour milk on the semolina so that it is completely covered in it. Keep the mixture like this for half an hour.\nIn a container, add milk, maida, semolina and rice powder. Add water gradually (around 2 cups), add rest of the ingredients and stir for sometime to get a consistent thick mix.\nHeat a non-stick pan. Brush the heated surface with oil (clear refined oil, do not use mustard or groundnut oil and sunflower oil is fine). Add drops of water on it and dry it gently with a soft cloth ball.\nAdd 1 ladle of the mix and spread it on the pan in a circular shape. Add 1 tablespoon filling in one side of the spread in a rectangular shape. Add oil on all 4 sides to give a soft fry. Roll the spread around the filling like a bread roll.\nKeep frying and rolling it around every 5-10 seconds till the pancake turns brownish and you notice small holes on it.\nServe hot or refrigerate.\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/patishapta-pitha-pancakes-with-coconut-filling/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Raisin","image":null,"objectID":1421244804,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/raisin/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Semolina","image":null,"objectID":1421244804,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/semolina/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Snacks","image":null,"objectID":1421244804,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"recipecourses","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipecourses/snacks/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Sugar","image":null,"objectID":1421244804,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/sugar/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Sweet","image":null,"objectID":1421244804,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"categories","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/categories/sweet/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Capsicum","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/capsicum/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Coriander","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/coriander/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Garam Masala","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/garam-masala/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Ginger","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/ginger/"},{"desc":"Cottage Cheese in a spicy tomato gravy","id":"Kadai Paneer","image":"kadaipaneer.png","objectID":1352843404,"priority":"100","recipeCategories":["Paneer"],"recipeCourses":["Appetizers","Main Course"],"recipeIngredients":["Capsicum","Chilli","Onion","Spicy","Tomato","Ginger","Coriander","Garam Masala","Kasoori Methi"],"recipeType":["Vegetarian"],"text":" If you are a follower of this blog, you will know that paneer is one of my favorite ingredients. I love paneer as much as I love chicken. I always try to experiment with different paneer dishes. However I have rarely tried to create a well-known paneer dish like Kadai Paneer. Since today is our weekly vegetarian day, I wanted to cook a paneer dish. I looked through some cookbooks and decided on creating a Kadai Paneer. The way I cook from a cookbook is I jot down all the ingredients, read through the steps multiple times and then try to cook from memory. The result always turn out similar but never a replica of the original as I always miss or change some step. I loved the aroma and taste of this Kadai Paneer and Sumi loved it too (which is a rarity as she doesn‚Äôt like paneer that much).\n Kadai Paneer is a very spicy tomato gravy based dish. There might be multiple variations to the dish. The level of hotness of the dish will vary with the amount of spices you add. If you want to make it less spicy please reduce the amount of chillies and spices.\n  Kadai Paneer \u0026#45; Cottage Cheese in a spicy tomato gravy   Ingredients  Paneer - 200 gm cut into thin pieces lengthwise Tomatoes - 4 to 5 cleaned and chopped Onion - 2 to 3 peeled Green chillies - 2 to 3 chopped Ginger - Around 0.5 inches crushed Capsicum - 2 cleaned and julienne cut Dried red chillies - 2-3 Coriander seeds - 2 tbsp Ginger-garlic paste - 2 tbsp Kasuri Methi powder - 1 tsp Garam Masala powder - 1 tsp Vegetable oil - 2-3 tbsp Salt to taste  Method Dry roast the coriander seeds and red chillies. Grind to a fine powder.\nIn a wok, heat oil. Add ginger-garlic paste and fry till the aroma spreads.\nAdd the tomatoes and saut√© till soft.\nAdd the powdered coriander seeds and red chillies to the tomatoes. Saute the mixture till the mixture is paste-like.\nWhen the oil starts to separate, add the capsicum and green chillies. Saute for 8 minutes till the capsicum gets cooked.\nAdd the onions and saut√© till translucent.\nAdd the garam masala powder and salt. Mix and blend this finely into the rest of the contents in the wok.\nAdd the paneer. Mix well the spices on the paneer to get the color. Cook for 3-4 minutes.\nAdd kasuri methi powder. Saute for another 2-3 minutes mixing everything together. Remove from heat.\nYou may also add coriander leaves to the mixture at this point.\nKadai Paneer is served best with rotis and nans.\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/kadai-paneer-cottage-cheese-spicy-tomato-gravy/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Kasoori Methi","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/kasoori-methi/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Low Carb","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"60","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"specialrecipes","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/specialrecipes/low-carb/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Main Course","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"recipecourses","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipecourses/main-course/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Paneer","image":null,"objectID":1352843404,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"categories","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/categories/paneer/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Cumin","image":null,"objectID":1352551988,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/cumin/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Fish","image":null,"objectID":1352551988,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"categories","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/categories/fish/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Lemon","image":null,"objectID":1352551988,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/lemon/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Nigella","image":null,"objectID":1352551988,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/nigella/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Non Vegetarian","image":null,"objectID":1352551988,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"recipetypes","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipetypes/non-vegetarian/"},{"desc":"White fish in cumin coriander sauce","id":"Paiya Fish Curry","image":"paiyafishcurry.png","objectID":1352551988,"priority":"100","recipeCategories":["Fish"],"recipeCourses":["Main Course"],"recipeIngredients":["Chilli","Onion","Spicy","Lemon","Nigella","Garlic","Turmeric","Cumin","Coriander"],"recipeType":["Non Vegetarian"],"text":" Diwali is around the corner. I miss the sweets and special fish dishes mom cooked for us around the festival holidays. Sumi and I don‚Äôt do anything special. But we try to have a different type of fish during these days which we would not have regularly. This is because fish is considered lucky and auspicious. We bought Paiya fish yesterday. I had it once before at a friend‚Äôs place and it tasted great. We didn‚Äôt want to wait till Tuesday to have it. Sumi wanted a gravy-like preparation so she went to work and created this delicious dish.\nThe dish will taste great with rice. That is how we would have had during our regular days. But since we are on our low-carb diet, we had just the fish but just for the kick of it, added a dose of fresh mozzarella cheese.

Don\u0026rsquo;t overcook the fish. Once the fish is fried, take it out. Take fresh oil again and heat it and add chopped onion, nigella seeds, red chillies, cumin and coriander powder, smashed garlic, chilli powder and saut√© a while for 2-3 min in low to medium flame. Once the onion turns golden brown, add the fishes back to it and add 100 ml of water and cook on low flame for another 5 min till the gravy thickens.

But ever since our low-carb diet begun, we have reduced our rice and bread intake by 90%. As a result, we always need to add some extra veggies (or fruits) or some other inventive cooking methods to have our chicken or fish curries. There was this time where we had slices of cheese (Mozzarella and Cheddar) along with chicken or the time when we grated Parmesan over the chicken.\nLast week we went out to have sizzler and after many days I tried chicken sizzler over a bed of rice. So today Sumi decided that we will have the chicken curry over a bed of veggies. The only leftovers in our fridge were spinach, tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli and mushrooms. Okay that‚Äôs a lot. I didn‚Äôt realize that LOL. Anyway we selected asparagus and mushrooms. I saut√©ed the veggies and Sumi did the curry. You do realize I did the easier stuff don‚Äôt you? So here goes the recipe.\n Chicken Curry with Veggies \u0026#45; Simple bengali curry on a bed of asparagus and mushrooms   Ingredients  Chicken - 800 gm cut in curry size pieces and cleaned Chilly powder - 2 tsp Turmeric powder - 1 tsp Ginger-garlic paste - 2 tsp Onion - 2 medium (sliced) Tomatoes - 2 (halved) Ghee/clarified butter - 1 tsp Butter - 50gm Kadai chicken masala (or any regular chicken masala) - 1 tsp Green chillies chopped - 1 tbsp Asafoetida (Heeng) - 1 pinch Mushroom - As required Asparagus - As required Vegetable oil/Canola oil - As required Salt - To taste  For Tempering\n Cinnamon - 2 sticks Black cardamom - 1 Star anise seeds - 3 Bay leaves - 2  For Garnish\n Coriander leaves - 1 tsbp (chopped) Fresh cream - 100ml  Method Marinate the chicken with some salt, some turmeric powder and set it aside for 15 min.\nIn a wok, add some oil and heat it up. Add all the tempering ingredients and saut√© in low flame for 30 sec.\nNow add the onion, green chillies, ginger-garlic paste, tomatoes, rest of turmeric powder, asafoetida, chilli powder, salt as required, kadai chicken powder and saut√© for 3-5 min in low to medium flame until the ginger-garlic paste is dry and oil separates. Take care not to burn it. Now add the chicken pieces and cook under medium to low flame saut√©ing in between. The chicken will be done in 20 minutes.\nIn a separate pan, heat the ghee and add the tempering ingredients. Now add the mixture to the chicken, stir and mix it well.\nIn a container, beat and mix the cream well.

After many days of constant work, we found free time this weekend. Sumi and I were reminiscing our childhood and I remembered the delicious Malpuas that mom used to make for us. She made it specifically for me as I loved them. Even though we have been to Kolkata 4 times the past 3 years, I last had Malpua 4 years back. I consciously asked mom not to prepare them for the past few years due to our low-carb diet. Believe me they are so delicious, I cannot stop at 1-3. I devour them like a monster. Malpuas are famous in the entire North India. The only difference amounts to the usage of the syrup. Bengalis love it completely soaked in the syrup while the rest of the Northern states tend to have it dry. Hope you give it a try.\n The Recipe calls for Khowa.

I am telling from experience.\n  Malpua \u0026#45; Pastry dipped in sweet syrup   Ingredients For the pastry\n Coconut - 1 Semolina - 1 cup Maida flour (Refined Wheat flour) - 2 cups Rice powder - 1 cup Sugar - 1.5 cups Baking powder - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Khowa - 100gm Milk - 1\u0026frasl;2 litre Bananas - 3 Sweet Fennel seeds - 1 tsp Refined Sunflower oil - For deep frying  For the sweetened syrup\n Powdered sugar - 700gm Water - 1 cup Cardamom - 2 (small sized) Rose water - For flavor (optional)  Method Take all ingredients (except the fennel seeds) and blend it into a thick mixture.\nAdd the sweet fennel seeds and mix well into the mixture.\nHeat oil in a wok. Using a large round spoon, take out the mixture and put it into the heated oil. Deep fry the mixture until golden brown. The spoon should be rounded so that we get the round shape of the pastry.\nIn a separate utensil, add 1 cup water. Add the powdered sugar. Mix well to create a sweetened syrup (Chasni). Add 2 small cardamom pieces in this chasni.\nSoak the deep-fried pastries in the chasni. Keep them soaked for at least 5-6 hours (the more the better).

I love the rains. I miss the fact that it rains here usually in the afternoon. When I was growing up at Ranchi, there were no such timing. In fact there were quite a few days when it rained 5-6 days continuously. I have special memories of the lunch mom used to serve during these days. After coming back from school, I had to have bath (else no lunch). And after that she used to serve traditional Bengali recipes. Believe me, I was not fond of vegetables but during rains when served hot I used to relish them. And the best such combination was Khichudi (or Khichdi) served with Papad and Aloo Poshto. It used to be both me and my brother‚Äôs favorite.\n Nirameesh Aloo Poshto \u0026#45; Pure Veg Potato Recipe with Poppy Seeds   Today I will post my mom‚Äôs version of the dish. It is the East Bengal style of preparing it. We will post the other version, when Sumi decides to make it and write about it because I have no clue how that one is made. Also this version is completely vegetarian (means it doesn‚Äôt use any onion and garlic too). Hope you all enjoy it.\nIngredients  Potato big - 4 Poppy Seeds (Khus Khus) - 100gm Green Chillies - 3-4 Kaalo Jeera (Black Cumin Seeds) - 1 pinch Heeng (Asafoetida) - 1 pinch Chilly Powder - 1 tsp Sugar - 1 tsp Turmeric Powder - 2 tsp Mustard Oil - 4 tbsp Salt - to taste Coriander Leaves - For garnish (optional)  Method Grind the poppy seeds and 2 green chillies into a paste (usually you need to dry roast the poppy seeds, then grind coarsely along with the chilies by adding little water). Make sure you make a proper paste but don\u0026rsquo;t make it runny. Keep aside.\nWash the pototoes. Peel and cut them into small cubes. Keep aside.\nIn a wok, heat mustard oil. Add a pinch of black cumin seeds and asafoetida. It will start sizzling immediately.\nAdd the potato cubes to the mixture and keep frying. When they start to get fried, add salt, turmeric powder, chilli powder and sugar. Slit 2 green chillies in the centre and add them to the mixture. Mix well.\nNow reduce the flame and cover the wok and let it cook. In regular intervals, remove the cover and stir it nicely.\nWhen everything mixes well and get fried properly, add the poppy seed paste that was kept aside. Mix well.\nCover the wok and let it cook. At regular intervals keep turning and stirring the mixture well and keep changing the flame from slow to medium and vice versa. The idea is to cook it well without burning the spices.\nIf the potatoes don\u0026rsquo;t get boiled properly, sprinkle water on the mixture and keep turning.\nOnce the complete mixture get fried properly and the potatoes are boiled well, remove from the flame.\nGarnish with coriander leaves.\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/nirameesh-aloo-poshto-potatoes-poppy-seeds/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Poppy Seeds","image":null,"objectID":1336019712,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/poppy-seeds/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Vegetables","image":null,"objectID":1336019712,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"categories","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/categories/vegetables/"},{"desc":null,"id":"April YBR Round Up","image":null,"objectID":1335776067,"priority":"0","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"Well from this month, I joined a \u0026quot;Your Best Recipe\u0026quot; Roundup that is promoted by Nancy from The Spicie Foodie\nThe roundup is really awesome.

When I was a kid (I am not one now despite what my mom wants me to believe), mom always made a paneer dish once a day. Lunch always used to contain fish, which is obvious as we were a typical Bengali family, but on Saturdays it was no fish. Instead we had a paneer dish. As far as I was concerned for me it made no difference. I loved fish, chicken and paneer equally. In fact some days when we had leftovers, I had to select between paneer or chicken and it used to be a very difficult decision indeed. So it is no surprise that when we visit Kolkata these days (that too once a year), paneer is an important ingredient in mom‚Äôs dishes. In fact this time when we visited, she made 4 different paneer dishes. Yummy!!\nSo today I am posting one of those 4 dishes. It is a classic in North Indian cuisine.

My parents are visiting us and there were lots of trips to the hospital to check whether everything is alright with them. Things are looking better now. The past few months haven‚Äôt been exciting cooking wise. We ate pretty regular stuff as mom wanted to eat regular food. My diet went for a toss as I really wanted to stop the low carb diet for few days. So over and all there was not much to blog about. However as I was looking at my notes, I stumbled upon my mom‚Äôs recipes which Sumi and I jotted down when we went to Kolkata during the winter. So over the course of next few posts you will find her delicious recipes.\n Pancharangi Chaatni \u0026#45; Sweet Chutney with Fruits and Veggies   Chutneys are a regular in any Indian menu, mostly as appetizers. But among Bengalis, it prominently features as a dessert quite often as a sweet. The tomato chutney (Chaatni in Bengali) is a regular and is also a special dish prepared on festivals. There is also the date chutney, jaggery chutney (khejuri gurer chaatni) and lots of other varieties. My mom makes a special chutney with 5 fruits and vegetables (hence the name pancharangi). It tastes different as in each spoonful you might find some other fruit. My mom made quite a lot of it that was supposed to have gone on for few days but the big fat me gobbled almost half of it in 1 day. Yum. Hopefully you all love it too.\n Some ingredients are typical Bengali ones. I have tried to explain it as best as I could. You can try a variation of spices though depending on what you get from your nearby Indian shop.\n Ingredients  Red Tomato - 6 Apple - 1 Carrot - 1 Aamsotto (fruit leather made out of mango pulp mixed with concentrated sugar solution and sun dried) - 50gm Cherry - 20gm Cashewnuts - 8-10 Raisins - 20gm Paanch Foron (Five spices) - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Bhaja Mosola Guro (Indian five spices dry roasted and grounded to powder) - 1 tsp Sugar - to taste Clear oil - 1 tbsp  Method Chop all the vegetables and fruits and set aside.\nIn a wok, add the oil and then the paanch foron and saute for 10-15 sec till the fragrances come out.\nAdd the cashew, raisin and the other chopped fruits and vegetables and cook covered for 15-20 min sauteing in between.

It‚Äôs going to be an exciting year ahead. We wish to thank all those readers who have started reading our blog last year. Your support means a lot. This blog almost stopped getting any updates due to our real lives but thankfully we revived it towards the later part of 2011. Our total recipe count stands at 22 now. Not a great number but this year we promise to be regular in our posts.\nSo what are our plans for this year. Well personally my resolution is to make my low-carb diet work. I have just been able to lose little weight ever since I started my diet. The main reason being I was never consistent. Due to my past tryst with stomach ailments, the moment I felt I was feeling not well, I went back to carbs. But not anymore. We plan to follow a regular plan (with bits of treats for us in between of course). Sumi‚Äôs target is maintaining her weight (she is within 3kg of her ideal weight). My target is reaching my ideal weight+5. I know it is achievable, I just need more discipline.\n Simple Salad to start the New Year \u0026#45; Healthy Salad Arrangement   With regards to this blog, we have plans to update this blog regularly with minimum 2 recipes per month. That should be a good start. But personally I would like to see that go up to 1 recipe per week. We are in good shape for the first few months as we have a bunch of recipes in the pipeline. I also have a collection of around 16-17 recipes by my mom which I wrote down and tasted during the New Year break when Sumi and I visited Kolkata. Of course none of them are low carb recipes, but then I do not follow the diet when I visit my parents.\nSo today I don‚Äôt exactly have a recipe for you. I just wanted to wish you a great year ahead and it already being 15th of Jan, I think I am already behind. So I simply show you a salad arrangement done by Sumi last year. This should inspire me to stay healthy. You all remember the last ice cream arrangement¬†I posted about. Well this salad arrangement was done just 3 days before that. Sumi is really creative and she loves doing these. I hope she stays like this thoughout and I get to post more wonderful creations from her.\nHappy 2012 everyone again.

We have not been regular with our posting this year too but things have picked up since November and I am happy for that reason. We are visiting our parents right now and we‚Äôve been here since 24th and we will go back to Bangalore on 1st. Sumi is still following her diet (minus the first day when she just couldn‚Äôt resist Mom‚Äôs cooking). In contrast, I have simply decided to forget that I am on a low carb diet for these days. That means yummy sweets and wonderful dishes from one. I have requested mom to stay simple. I want to have simple home cooked meals. The result is a fabulous collection of 7 recipes so far in 4 days - not bad at all. And we have 4 full days left. All these recipes will come up on the site and trust me you will love them.\nBack to the post, Sumi wants me to close the \u0026ldquo;being fishy\u0026rdquo; series now. I have one more of the fish recipe from that day in my archives and it was another of those yummy ones that Sumi made. This time it was from the frozen fish fillets that we got from the Super market. I love this brand. It is called Ocean Fresh Fish Fillets. It tastes yummy even with a simple preparation. It has no fishy smell and its very clean.

Now add the fillets and fry for 3-4 minutes in medium heat. Turn them after 2 min. Fish cooks in very less time. Take care not to fry too much as it will become flaky. Set aside the fried fish fillets.\nIn the same pan, add coriander paste, cumin paste, red chilli paste, garlic paste and ginger paste. Saut√© for a min. Now add the sliced onion, leeks, tomato and saut√© again for 2-3 minutes. Once the paste is fried just enough, you will get a good aroma of ginger garlic and oil separates from the paste.\nNow add the fillets back in the pan and add 80-100 ml of water and increase the flame.

Mom tells me that the first thing I had at my \u0026ldquo;Annaprashan\u0026rdquo;, or the Hindu rite of passage, was fish even though they tried to push in rice grin. In our culture, rice should be the 1st food which an infant takes during the ceremony but I just loved the smell and taste of fish. Throughout my childhood, I loved fish so much that I used to get upset if there was no fish during lunch any day. All this changed when I went to college. Then I realized, my love was the fish prepared by my mom in traditional Bengali style. My fish drought had begun ever since I started my engineering. But thanks to my better half, our marriage re-introduced fish to my tummy. It is an essential part in our current diet as fish has one of the lowest (in fact nil in many cases) carb content.\nContinuing with being fishy, this was the second dish that Sumi cooked on her ‚Äúbeing nutty‚Äù day. This is a classic Bengali dish which I have adored all my life. Recently, ever since we started on the diet, I stopped having this. The reason being that the dish goes best with rice. For me any non-vegetarian curry without rice just doesn‚Äôt gel well, especially fish. But that day we just went crazy. We were missing fish curry and we decided to have it without rice. The result was awesome and my life had come back after the first taste.\n Macher Tel Jhol \u0026#45; Fresh water carp gravy in oil base   Ingredients  Rohu Fish (Rui Maach in Bengali, Indian fresh water Carp) - 8 slices (approx 800gm) Ginger paste - 1.5 tbsp Garlic paste - 1 tsp Cumin paste - 3 tbsp Coriander paste - 1 tbsp Turmeric powder - 1 tbsp Red Chilli powder - 1 tbsp (or as per taste) Onion (medium sized and chopped thin) - 1 Green chillies (slit length wise) - 4-5 Mustard Amount - Considerable amount Salt - to taste Parsley (chopped fresh) - 1 tsp  Method First marinade the fish with turmeric powder and salt. Set it aside for 15-20 min.\nIn a deep wok, add mustard oil, heat till oil smokes (not a good option usually, however since our main curry element is the mustard oil, we need to heat it properly else it imparts a strong smell). Now add the fish pieces, fry on each side till light brown. Set it aside.\nDiscard the oil. Clean the pan or take another and add fresh mustard oil again (approx 100 ml) and heat it till it smokes. Reduce flame; add chopped onion, slit green chillies, add all the paste, fry till oil separates like about 4-5 minutes. Now add 100 ml of water, a bit of salt (required for gravy) and let the water boil and then add the fish pieces back and coat properly with the gravy.\nGarnish with chopped fresh parsley leaves.\nThe oil added in the dish may seem a lot but this is the beauty of this dish.

You obviously know why? Our Diet!! Sometimes we feel frustrated with the diet. Even a single day matters. Sumi had reached her target weight quite a few months back. Believe it or not but she lost a whopping 37kg since she started on the diet. But she is struggling now to maintain it. I, on the other hand, have lost around 12kg since the start which is horrible. I never followed the diet closely. But one thing that frustrates us is that even if we have carbohydrates one single day, it reflects on the weight negatively. And since we are already frustrated, we respond by having more yummy carb filled food LOL. But yes, we can safely attest that a low-carb diet works. In our case, it‚Äôs the only diet that has worked without making us mad with hunger.\nSo what does this have to do with ice cream. Well, in one such frustration filled day, we bought a tub of ice cream (Vanilla flavored of course since that‚Äôs my favorite). My parents were also here and my mom adores ice cream. In fact this is her only drawback in her otherwise healthy and disciplined diet. Now Sumi loves watching mom have ice cream which she eats slowly and enjoys every helping like a kid.

There is not only a variety of food but even the ingredients used in different parts of the country are so different, sometimes ending up being downright conflicting. Take fish and curd for example. Bengalis swear by it. I posted a recipe before, Doi Maach, that combined these 2 ingredients. But these same ingredients together in one dish is taboo in South India. It‚Äôs the same with various other ingredients too. So funny really.\nBack to our recipe, I was updating the blog today with a new theme and ended up using a theme from Studiopress. That was when I noticed, how slacky we have been with the blog. It was then that I decided that regular updates will be a part of this blog now. So when Sumi made this delicious recipe for the evening I just had to post it. This was the first time we actually got fresh fillet directly from the market. We usually have fresh water fish. But fishes like Rohu and Catla we get here in Bangalore are not fresh and tasty like in Kolkata. Hence we have moved towards sea water fishes like Emperor and Salmon which mostly have a neutral taste and smell. I hope you enjoy the recipe.\n Fish Fry with Yoghurt Sauce \u0026#45; Emperor Fish Fry with Spicy Yoghurt Sauce   Ingredients To Marinade Fish\n Emperor (or Indian Salmon) fish fillet (approx 400gm) - 2 Salt - 1.5 tsp Peppercorns (crushed) - 12 Lemon Juice - 1\u0026frasl;2  For the Sauce\n Yoghurt (thick) - 150gm Fresh Cream - 100ml Salt - 1\u0026frasl;3 tsp Garam Masala powder - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Black Pepper grounded - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Red Chilli powder - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Onion (small and sliced thin) - 1\u0026frasl;2 Garlic cloves (minced) - 2  For Cooking\n Butter - 100gm Vegetable oil - 2 tbsp Parsley (for topping) - 1 tbsp  Method Marinade the fish with marinade items and keep in refrigerator for 2 hrs.\nIn a non stick pan, heat 50 gm butter with vegetable oil, in low heat to avoid burning of butter. Fry each fillet one by one keeping the skin side on first for 3-4 minutes and then turning over the other side. You can cover the pan for quick frying and the fillets will stay moist.\nOnce the filler is fried, take out from the pan and set aside.\nMix well yoghurt, cream, salt, ground pepper, garam masala and chilli powder.\nClean up the pan. Put the remaining butter and onion. Saute till onion is translucent. Add garlic and lower the heat to minimum. saute for a min. Switch off the gas and add the yoghurt mix you just prepared. Mix well with butter sauce. Do not heat as yoghurt will become grainy then.\nOn a plate arrange one fillet. Pour half the sauce and top with fresh chopped parsley. Similarly arrange the other plate.\nServes well for 2 persons when taken as main dish and serves four when served as side dish. Can go well with pulao/rice.\nEnjoy!\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/fish-fry-with-spicy-yoghurt-sauce/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Peppercorn","image":null,"objectID":1323004451,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/peppercorn/"},{"desc":"Prawn with Cashewnut Paste Curry","id":"Kaju Chingri Curry","image":"kajuchingricurry.jpg","objectID":1308461754,"priority":"100","recipeCategories":["Prawn"],"recipeCourses":["Main Course"],"recipeIngredients":["Cashewnut","Capsicum","Chilli","Onion","Garlic","Cumin","Coriander","Ginger","Turmeric","Butter"],"recipeType":["Non Vegetarian"],"text":" I guess Prawns are growing on me.

I say strange because I have started to like them a little now, even though there are only few types of preparation that I like now. I had a friend in my class who once commented that no self-respecting Bengali can not like prawns. Well I think that makes me a self-loathing Bengali :p But I am not. Sumi, on the other hand, simply adores them. She always found it hard to believe that I dont like them. Around the time we started living together after I moved to Chennai after our marriage, I consciously tried to force myself to try few ingredients which I didnt like before. There were two reasons for it. One I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to deprive Sumi of food items she loves. Second I wanted Sumi to have more of few vegetables which I love :D So prawns, mushrooms, spinach, carrot etc. became regulars in our diet. With the frozen, packed, cleaned up versions of prawns that we get nowadays in the super market, I have actually discovered my love for prawns. They are tasty and I just love them now.\nThis recipe in very common in Bengal and it is a favorite in any special occasions.

Due to us following the low carb diet the easiest way has been blindly consuming chicken. The veggies which are best for our diet are mostly the premium ones in terms of price. Moreover Sumi hates almost all vegetables except potato. Especially when most of the time we can have just boiled veggies. As you guys might know, the wife is the ‚Äúking‚Äù of the house so I just have never been able to force her to have more veggies.\nBut there has been a sudden change in her the past few weeks. She has told me that she is a bit fed up of having just chicken. She wants some other taste and have more vegetables. Yay!! So the past few days we have had quite a lot of veg preparations even though they are not purely Bengali styled recipes. The reason being less oil to be used and obviously reduced spices.\nCoccinia  or Ivy Gourd or Kenduri (Bengali Name) helps in maintaining the blood pressure and reduces the sugar levels.

The new year has been quite busy so far. Lots going on in our personal and professional lives. As a result we couldn‚Äôt experiment much with the food. Coupled up with our low carb diet, its safe to say that the new year has been a disaster in terms of food smiles However we did go to Calcutta in December/January and this time we made sure to pick up some recipes from our moms. So those will surely go up in this blog. Today we will share with you a mutton recipe, which incidentally is the first mutton recipe that Sumi has been satisfied about.\nMutton usually is part of regular diet at Calcutta. My parents love it a lot. I love it too but I prefer the home cooked mutton mostly. Due to our jobs it becomes very difficult to shop for mutton here in the area we live and weekends we usually get so lazy that we don‚Äôt travel much. So most of the time if we get the mutton it is from the Hypermarts where the muttons are pre-cut into cubes. Mutton usually takes more time and we 2 lazy bums don‚Äôt like to wait that long. However we took a chance and bought mutton again, this time from Spar Hypermart in Malleshwaram. And guess what it tasted awesome. Sumi really outdid herself. And it cooked quite fast too. Hope you enjoy it.\n Mutton Manpasand \u0026#45; Spicy Mutton Curry with a tinge of sweetness   Ingredients  Mutton (medium sized pieces) - 800gm Onion medium sized - 5 (Two grated, two peeled and one cut into big square) Red chillies (soaked in water for 1\u0026frasl;2 hour and ground into paste) - 7-8 Ginger paste - 2 tbsp Garlic paste - 1 tbsp Green chillies (slit lengthwise) - 7-8 Curd - 2 tbsp Turmeric powder - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Cumin powder - 1 tsp Coriander powder - 2 tsp Garam masala powder (or meat masala powder) - 1 tsp Coriander leaves (chopped) - 2 tbsp Butter - 1 tbsp Vegetable oil - 4 tbsp Mustard oil - 2 tbsp Sugar - 1 tsp Salt - to taste Water - 150ml Capsicum (cut into medium pieces) - 1 Cinnamon sticks - 2 (1 inch sized) Bay leaf (big) - 1 Green cardamom crushed - 1 Tomato (big sized finely chopped) - 1  Method Marination\nMarinate the mutton with curd, turmeric, grated onions, salt, ginger paste, garlic paste, mustard oil, Vegetable oil, sugarfree/sugar, half of red chilli paste and chopped tomato. Set it aside in refigerator for 1-2 hrs.\nPreparation\nHeat some oil in a wok, fry the capsicum for 1-2 min. Set it aside.\nHeat remaining vegetable oil in a pressure cooker, add cinnamon sticks, cardamom, bayleaf, squared onions, remaining ginger paste, garlic paste and green chillies. Fry for 3-4 minutes in medium to low flame. Now add the butter, cumin powder, coriander powder, meat masala powder and fry a little more.\nNow add the marinated chicken to it and add fried capsicum and half of chopped coriander leaves and cook slowly in low heat turning time to time. Take care that the gravy should not stick to the bottom of the cooker. Cook for 10 min - 15 min when gravy starts thickening. Now add the water to it and mix it well with gravy. Cover the cooker and let it whistle for 7 times in low heat. Mutton takes much longer time to cook.\nLet the pressure settle automatically, open the cooker and stir gently.\nServe the mutton with rice or chapatti.

Especially during the festive Durga Puja seasons, if you walk even 100 metres I am sure you will find at least 5-6 egg roll stalls. I missed it this year as I couldnt visit Calcutta during the Durga Puja this year.\nBack to the recipe, these egg rolls were made some 8 months back, we took the pic but I never got the time to post the recipe.

To be honest, today is one of those days when I have got that ‚Äúcarb crash‚Äù, which I talked about in the previous post. Every time when we have this huge curb, we dont fall into the temptations and have breads and stuff.

Add water if necessary.\nDivide the dough into medium sized balls and roll them with a rolling pin to make round like chapatti. Set it aside.\nMeanwhile, de-seed cucumber and cut into 2inch size thin julienne. Similarly cut onion and slit green chillies diagonally. Set them aside.\nHeat the chapatti in a non-stick pan frequently turning sides. Take care it should not turn brown. After a min, add a little oil on each side and turn it. Set it aside. (The chapatti should be soft and can be easily torn in pieces)\nBeat one egg with 2-3 drops of lemon juice and a pinch of salt.\nPut little oil in the same pan and heat it, spread the egg mix and make a round shape omelette. Cook with sim flame so that the bottom does not burn and egg is cooked slowly. Do not turn the side. Now gently put the chapatti you have cooked before on top of omelette. Now turn both together on a plate (omelette should be in the inner side of roll and chapatti should be outer side).\nAdd the cucumber, onion, chilli juliennes, add rock salt, pinch of chat powder, tomato sauce, chilli sauce and carefully roll. Secure the ends by wrapping it with a butter paper. Use a toothpick to firm the central part.\nRepeat the same process for making more rolls.\nServe with chutney/ketchup.\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/egg-roll/"},{"desc":null,"id":"Bread","image":null,"objectID":1291205663,"priority":"1","recipeCategories":null,"recipeCourses":null,"recipeIngredients":null,"recipeType":null,"text":"","typeofpage":"ingredients","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/ingredients/bread/"},{"desc":"Crumbled bread snack with nuts and veggies","id":"Bread Poha","image":"breadpoha.jpg","objectID":1291205663,"priority":"100","recipeCategories":["Vegetables"],"recipeCourses":["Appetizers","Snacks"],"recipeIngredients":["Bread","Mustard","Onion","Chilli","Groundnut"],"recipeType":["Vegetarian"],"text":" Well its been a long time and we have not added any recipe.

But what can you do when your plans go awry? Actually in our case we felt hungry :-p So Sumi ran and looked into the fridge and there we had Paneer (Cottage Cheese). Our quickest option in such cases is Grilled Paneer. But guess what Sumi decided to go for something rich in masala and oil - typical Indian style. Presenting Paneer Vegetable Delight‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n Paneer Vegetable Delight \u0026#45; Cottage Cheese with Cauliflower, Potato and Capsicum   Ingredients  Cauliflower (cut into medium sized florets) - 1\u0026frasl;2 Potato - 3 medium sized sliced into thin pieces Cottage Cheese (Paneer) - 200gm diagonally cut into 1 inch cubes Cauliflower tender leaves/stems from its inner part - 10-12 Capsicum sliced thin - 1 medium sized Onion cut into thin slices - 1 Green Chillies cut diagonally - 4 Onion paste - 2 tbsp Tomato paste/puree - 4 tbsp Ginger Garlic paste - 1 tbsp Curd - 2 tbsp Red Chilli powder - 1 tsp Whole Garam Masala - 1 tsp Asafoetida (optional) - 1\u0026frasl;4 tsp Garam Masala powder - 1 tsp Kitchen King powder - 1 tsp Turmeric powder - 1\u0026frasl;2 tsp Vegetable oil - 2 tbsp Oil - Extra to shallow fry Sugar - a pinch Salt - to taste  Method Heat oil in a non-stick wok, add green chilli, cauliflowers (along with tender leaves) and capsicum and shallow fry them for around 5 minutes in medium flame till the cauliflower florets turn light golden colour. Make sure you keep turning the vegetables for the entire 5 mins. Now take the vegetables out and dry out the oil and keep them aside.\nStir fry the Paneer pieces for 1 minutes till they turn light brown. Keep it aside.\nUse around 2 tbsp of the oil (that you used during shallow frying) and heat it in a pressure cooker/pan. In sequence first add whole garam masala, cut onions (with a pinch of salt and sugar - prevents onion from burning), onion paste, ginger garlic paste and all the spices and keep stirring in medium flame for 5 minutes. Now add the tomato paste (or puree) and curd and keep stirring in medium to high flame for 2 minutes. Now add the potatoes and cook in medium flame for 5 minutes. Take care the spices get mixed and cooked evenly. You may add around 50ml of water if you feel that there is no oil left. This prevents addition of more oil and the spices move around freely and get cooked evenly.\nOnce the potatoes get cooked, add the remaining vegetables you kept aside in the first step and keep turning all the ingredients.\nFinally add the stir fried paneer cubes into the vegetables, close the cooker lid and in high flame wait for 1 whistle and after that immediately drain out the remaining steam (otherwise the cauliflowers become very soft).\nTake out the lid. You may garnish it with fresh coriander leaves. Serve it with any Indian bread or simply plain old bread.\n","typeofpage":"recipe","url":"https://www.enjoyable.recipes/recipe/paneer-vegetable-delight/"},{"desc":"Okra with Potato","id":"Bhindi Aloo Dry","image":"bhindialoodry.jpg","objectID":1266247758,"priority":"100","recipeCategories":["Vegetables"],"recipeCourses":["Breakfast","Main Course"],"recipeIngredients":["Okra","Potato","Onion","Coriander","Chilli","Garam Masala","Turmeric","Asafoetida"],"recipeType":["Vegetarian"],"text":" Bhindi is one of the most loved vegetables in India.
